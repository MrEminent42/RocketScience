A game created for Dr. Delgado's Rocket Science genetic learning assignment in my 10th Grade Honors Artificial Intelligence class. More information can be found on [my blog](https://ai.leohorwitz.com/2019/05/genetic-machine-learning.html).

Use the space bar to try and land the rocket without killing the people inside, or running out of fuel!
